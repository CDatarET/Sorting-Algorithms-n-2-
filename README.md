# Sorting Algorithms: Bubble, Selection, and Insertion Sort

## 1. Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process continues until no more swaps are needed.

- **Time Complexity**: O(n²) in the worst and average cases.
- **Best Case**: O(n) when the array is already sorted.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) – in-place sort.
- **Stable**: Yes

## 2. Selection Sort
Selection Sort divides the array into a sorted and an unsorted region. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted region and moves it to the end of the sorted region.

- **Time Complexity**: O(n²) for all cases.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) – in-place sort.
- **Stable**: No (can be made stable with modifications)

## 3. Insertion Sort
Insertion Sort builds the sorted array one element at a time by picking the next element and placing it in its correct position relative to the already sorted portion.

- **Time Complexity**: O(n²) worst and average.
- **Best Case**: O(n) when the array is nearly sorted.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) – in-place sort.
- **Stable**: Yes
